1. Install stack if you don't have it installed:
```sh
ghcup install stack
```
2. Unzip all the files to the same directory with `HW5.hs`
3. Install the `HUnit` and `temporary` packages:

```sh
stack install HUnit
stack install temporary
```
4. Due to the interactive nature of this exercise, testing a is a bit different...

```sh
python3 run_tests.py
```
